		<p>  <font size="5" > I was born in 1997, at a small hospital in a town called Brockton, Massachusetts. <br> <image src = "Kid Jaret.jpg" align="left" border = "2" length ="150" width ="150" >
		My mom was a stay at home mom who took care of my older three siblings at the time. My dad was a k9 police officer and worked at night mainly. A few years after I was born, I had two more siblings brought into our family. My mom homeschooled all 6 of us through most of elementary school and through all of highschool.
		When I turned 16 I got my permit and a job shortly following that. My first job was at McDonalds where I worked for 8 months there. Fortunately, I had a friend who worked at a go kart track called <a href="http://www.f1boston.com">  F1 Boston </a>.  That was an amazing job that I worked until I came to college.
		College was something I always knew that I needed to do. The problem was I didn't know what I wanted to do. My parents suggested (very heavily) that I go to <a href = http://www.bju.edu/> Bob Jones University </a>. My older three siblings had attended the university and two of them had graduated from it already.I decided to take I.T. while I am down here.
