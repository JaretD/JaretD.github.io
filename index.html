		<p>  <font size="5" > I was born in 1997, at a small hospital in a town called Brockton, Massachusetts. My mom was a stay at home mom who took care of my older three siblings at the time. My dad was a k9 police officer and worked at night mainly. A few years after I was born, I had two more siblings brought into our family. My mom homeschooled all 6 of us through most of elementary school and through all of highschool.
		When I turned 16 I got my permit and a job shortly following that. My first job was at McDonalds where I worked for 8 months there. Fortunately, I had a friend who worked at a go kart track called <a href="http://www.f1boston.com">  F1 Boston </a>.  That was an amazing job that I worked until I came to college.
		College was something I always knew that I needed to do. The problem was I didn't know what I wanted to do. My parents suggested (very heavily) that I go to <a href = http://www.bju.edu/> Bob Jones University </a>. My older three siblings had attended the university and two of them had graduated from it already.I decided to take I.T. while I am down here.

			Since I was a kid, I have very much been interested in guns. Unfortunately, I have never gotten the chance to shoot one, but I have done the next best thing, I love to airsoft.
			Airsoft guns are guns that use electricity, c02 or springs to launch plastic bb's at other people. I have been doing it for years and it is a ton of fun. I also enjoy playing a card game called MTG. 
			It is a mix of math, chess, and strategy put all in one game that is very addicting. I'm also very much into chess. My brothers taught me how to play a long time ago and since I have been at college, 
			I try to play a couple of games every day.

						My favorite pastime though, is racing. Like I said before, I work at a go kart track. There are three tracks: the city course, country course, and the outdoor course.
						The indoor courses are both .25 miles long while the outdoor track is 1.4 miles long. I had never raced a go kart in my life before working at F1 and it was scary experience. 
						The karts indoors go 50mph while the ones outdoors go 60mph. It is so much fun to go and race other people.
